// Prim's algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, weighted undirected graph. The minimum spanning tree is a subgraph that connects all the vertices of the original graph with the minimum possible total weight.

Here's an overview of Prim's algorithm:

1. Initialization:
   - Choose a starting vertex as the root of the MST.
   - Create a set to track the vertices included in the MST, initially empty.
   - Assign an infinite key value to all vertices except the root, which is assigned a key value of 0.
   - Assign null or a special value to the parent of all vertices, indicating no parent initially.

2. Selecting Vertices:
   - While there are vertices not yet included in the MST:
   - Choose the vertex with the minimum key value from the set of vertices not yet included in the MST.
   - Add this vertex to the MST set.

3. Updating Key Values:
   - For the selected vertex, update the key values of its adjacent vertices if they are not already included in the MST and the weight of the edge connecting them is smaller than the current key value.
   - Set the selected vertex as the parent of the updated vertices.

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all vertices are included in the MST set.

The resulting MST will be a tree that spans all the vertices of the original graph with the minimum possible total weight. The algorithm continuously grows the MST from a single vertex, iteratively selecting the vertex with the minimum key value and updating the key values of adjacent vertices.

Prim's algorithm has a time complexity of O(V^2) using an adjacency matrix representation of the graph, where V is the number of vertices. However, by using data structures like binary heaps or Fibonacci heaps, the time complexity can be reduced to O(E log V), where E is the number of edges in the graph.

Prim's algorithm is widely used in network design, clustering, and other optimization problems where finding the minimum spanning tree is crucial.
