Node=>Node show's an element may be child or parent

Root=>starting point of the Trees

parent=>which are having child Node

siblings=>child which having more then ones

Ancestor=>start from the child and trivarse the parent all parent is Ancestor for this child

Descendant=>start from the parent and trivarse the child all child is Descendant for this parent

Leaf=Node which are not having any child called the leaf Node

                                                Binary Tree

   Tree which having maximum two child or minimum 0 called binary Tree
   So binary tree ka Node ma 3 cheez hogi data , left child,right child

  L=>Go for the left child
  N=>Just Print the Node
  R=>Go for the right child
